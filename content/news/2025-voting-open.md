Voting is now officially OPEN for the Byte of Melon Community Game Awards 2025! Read below to learn more about the show and how voting works.

# What is the Byte of Melon Community Game Awards 2025?
The Byte of Melon Game Awards is an annual game award show presented by Michael Webb, aka "Byte of Melon", on his Twitch channel, <NuxtLink to="https://twitch.tv/byteofmelon">https://twitch.tv/byteofmelon</NuxtLink>.

The goal of the show is to allow the audience to run the show by allowing winners to be chosen by the audience (from a select number of candidates decided by the Byte of Melon Community Game Awards Nomination Committee). The committee exists to pick interesting categories and legitimate choices for each of these categories, but still provide the final decision to our community in the spirit of the show. After all, it is our belief that video games deserve to be honored by the gamers, not the media.

To learn more about the show and its nominees, please <NuxtLink to="/about">see our about page</NuxtLink>.

# How Voting Works
Before voting occurs, categories and nominees must be decided. Nominations are decided by the BOM Community Game Awards Nomination Committee. The Committee takes into account several factors, such as popularity amongst gamers on various social media platforms, the nominations made by The Game Awards (if applicable), and their own personal experiences with the game.

Once the Nomination Committee picks the categories and nominees, a Google Form is opened to the public to decide the final winners in each category. Most category votes are optional, making sure people only pick if they are properly informed. Voting in as many categories as you can is encouraged to allow more voices to be heard at the award ceremony. If a vote is currently open, you can click the button below.

# Vote Now!
