# UPDATE - 12/29/2024
Voting for 2024 closed on December 28, 2024. However, the original content of this post has been preserved below for archival.

# How Voting Works
Before voting occurs, categories and nominees must be decided. Nominations are decided by the TRM Community Game Awards Nomination Committee. The Committee takes into account several factors, such as popularity amongst gamers on various social media platforms, the nominations made by The Game Awards (if applicable), and their own personal experiences with the game.

Once the Nomination Committee picks the categories and nominees, a Google Form is opened to the public to decide the final winners in each category. Most category votes are optional, making sure people only pick if they are properly informed. Voting in as many categories as you can is encouraged to allow more voices to be heard at the award ceremony.
