The Byte of Melon Game Awards is an annual game award show presented by Michael Webb, aka "Byte of Melon", on his Twitch channel, <NuxtLink to="https://twitch.tv/byteofmelon">twitch.tv/byteofmelon</NuxtLink>.<br /><br />
                    
The goal of the show is to allow the audience to run the show by allowing winners to be chosen by the audience (from a select number of candidates decided by the Byte of Melon Community Game Awards Nomination Committee). The committee exists to pick interesting categories and legitimate choices for each of these categories, but still provide the final decision to our community in the spirit of the show. After all, it is our belief that video games deserve to be honored by the gamers, not the media.
